# RL-Experiments

The motivation of this project is to compare and modify deep reinforcement learning algorithms easily **for experiments**.

|  | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Engineering** | Consistent agent style | Not highly modularized |
| **Academic** | Easy to modify and fine-tune<br>More comments for detail theory and tricks | A little unfriendly for DRL beginners |

# Implemented algorithms
